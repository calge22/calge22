# **Introduction**
## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Clara Alger
- This is my *first* year-long coding class. My only previous experience is an asynchrnous intro course I took this summer.
- I'm excited to take this class to gain a better understanding of what coding really is, and to see if I might want to contiue to take classes in this field.
- At GA I help run The Edition and Feminist Forum, and run cross country. Outside of school I love to dance!
- Although I don't quite know what kinds of projects we will be working on, I'd love to figure out how to make a simple game.
- I'm a little worried about nailing the syntax of the language and dealing with the frustration of debugging, but I know we'll figure it out :)
